One of my hobbies is to implement previously published research papers and reproduce the results of them.
Here is the list of papers which I have implemented so far.
All papers are implemented in either C++ or Python. (Some of them are no longer maintained. Sorry)

### Complex adaptive systems

- [<a href="https://github.com/toru34/minority_game" target="_blank">C++</a>]: D. Challet and Y.-C. Zhang. Emergence of cooperation and organization in an evolutionary game. Physica A. 1997.

### Natural language processing

- [<a href="https://github.com/toru34/kim_emnlp_2014" target="_blank">Python</a>]: Y. Kim. Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification. EMNLP. 2014.

- [<a href="https://github.com/toru34/rush_emnlp_2015" target="_blank">Python</a>]: A. M. Rush et al. A Neural Attention Model for Sentence Summarization. EMNLP. 2015.

- [<a href="https://github.com/toru34/zhou_acl_2017" target="_blank">Python</a>]: Q. Zhou et al. Selective Encoding for Abstractive Sentence Summarization. ACL. 2017.

- [<a href="https://github.com/toru34/li_emnlp_2017" target="_blank">Python</a>]: P. Li et al. Deep Recurrent Generative Decoder for Abstractive Text Summarization. EMNLP. 2017.
