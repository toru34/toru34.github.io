# Python tutorials

Below we list some excellent tutorials on Python, with a bias towards ones that focus on ML/ datascience.

## Software development tools

In datascience / ML, it is common to use  
 <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>,
which mix code and results.
We use the [Google colab version of notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/), which run on the Google Compute Platform (GCP),
so you don't have to install code locally.
See [this colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/colab_intro.ipynb).

When developing larger software projects locally, it is often better to use an 
 IDE (interactive development environment),
 which keeps the code separate from the results.
I like to use 
<a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org">Spyder</a>,
although many people use
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>.
For a browser-based IDE, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab">JupyterLab</a>.
