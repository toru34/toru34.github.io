# JAX 


[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is a  version of NumPy that runs fast on CPU, GPU and TPU, by compiling down to XLA. It also has an excellent automatic differentiation library, extending the earlier [autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) package, which makes it easy to compute higher order derivatives, per-example gradients (instead of aggregated gradients), and gradients of complex code (e.g., optimize an optimizer).
The JAX interface is almost identical to NumPy (by design), but with some small differences, and lots of additional features.
 More details can be found in the other tutorials listed below.

## JAX libraries related to ML

in this tutorial, we focus on core JAX.
However, since JAX is quite low level (like numpy), many libraries are being developed
that build on top of it, to provide more specialized functionality.
We summarize a few of the ML-related libraries below.
See also https://github.com/n2cholas/awesome-jax which has a more extensive list.

### DNN libraries

JAX is a purely functional library, which differs from Tensorflow and
Pytorch, which are stateful. The main advantages of functional programming
are that  we can safely transform the code, and/or run it in parallel, without worrying about
global state changing behind the scenes. The main disadvantage is that code (especially DNNs) can be harder to write.
To simplify the task, various DNN libraries have been designed, as we list below. In this book, we use Flax.
