'''
Implements inference in a Bayes net using autodiff applied to Z=einsum(factors).
 murphyk@gmail.com, April 2019
 Based on "A differential approach to inference in Bayesian networks"
 Adnan Darwiche, JACM 2003.

 The idea of using einsum instead of an arithmetic circuit to compute Z
 is based on

 Darwiche defines the network polynomial f(l) = poly(l, theta),
 where l(i,j)=1 if variable i is in state j; these
 are called  the evidence vectors, denoted by lambda. 
 Let e be a vector of observations for a (sub)set of the nodes.
 Let o(i)=1 if variable i is observed in e, and o(i)=0 otherwise.
 So l(i,j)=ind{j=e(i)) if o(i)=1, and l(i,:)=1 otherwise.
 Thus l(i,j)=1 means the setting x(i)=j is compatible with e.
 Define f(e) = f(l(e)), where l(e) is this binding process.
 Thm 1: f(l(e)) = Pr(x(o)=e) = Pr(e), the probability of the evidence.
 f(e) is also denoted by Z, the normalization constant in Bayes rule.
 Note that we can compute f(e) using einstein summation over all terms
 in the network poly.
 Thm 2: let g_{i,j}(l)= d/dl(i,j) f(l(e)) be partial derivative.
 so g_i(l) is the gradient vector for variable i.
 Then g_ij(l) = Pr(x(i)=j, x(o(-i))=e(-i)), where o(-i) are all observed
 variables except i.
 Corollary 1. d/dl(i,j) log f(l(e)) = 1/f(l(e)) * g_{ij}(l(e))
   = Pr(x(i)=j | e) if o(i)=0 (so i not in e). 
 This is the standard result that derivatives of the log partition function
 gives the expected sufficient statistics, which for a multinomial
 are the posterior marignals over states.
 We use jax (https://github.com/google/jax) to compute the partial
 derivatives. This requires that f(e) be implemented using jax's
 version of einsum, which fortunately is 100% compatible with the numpy
 version.
