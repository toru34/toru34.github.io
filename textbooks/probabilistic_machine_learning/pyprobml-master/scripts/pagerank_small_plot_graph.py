Draws a 6-node "tiny web" . This is from Section 2.11 of "Numerical Computing with MATLAB"
by Cleve Moler, SIAM, 2004.

This demo only operates on a single graph which consists of 6 nodes and draws
the initial state of the graph.
Furthermore, note that this demo does not show the PageRank is actually computed  Instead
the eigenvalue problem A*x=x is solved for x, where A is the Markov
transition matrix, A = p*G*D + e*z', where G is the binary matrix used here.
The method here is a simplistic random-hopping demonstration of the Markov
process, to motivate the A*x=x formulation of the problem. In this example,
A does control how the transitions are made, but the matrix A is not formed
explicitly.

Modifed by Kevin Murphy 26 Nov 97: I just changed the node names
to numbers, for brevity and ease of comparison to entries in the matrix/vector
